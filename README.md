### About 
Hello and Welcome to My Portfolio!

My name is Elodie Lopes, and I am glad to have you here. In this repository, you'll find several folders and sub-folders containing projects that showcase my ongoing learning in data exploration, analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis.

### Background 
I am a physicist currently completing my PhD in Biomedical Engineering. I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Physics from the University of Aveiro, Portugal.

For my Bachelor's thesis, I studied the interaction of a test scalar field, described by the Klein-Gordon equation, with Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. This involved solving linear ordinary differential equations derived from the Klein-Gordon equation using Leaver's computational method.

My Master's thesis focused on the Kuramoto model in complete graphs and scale-free networks, particularly examining random fields with constant magnitude and Gaussian distribution.

Presently, I am finishing my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto, Portugal. My doctoral research is centered on contributions to the study of neurostimulation biomarkers for improved management of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease.
